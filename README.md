# LifeinIndia
this is my first project.
it's a app about my 40 days life in India.
I start learn android in this summer vacation,I use what i have learned to create this project.
now I hava almost finished it.
  the app doesn't have all the data about the life in India,because I have to learn a quickly and convenint way to add the 
data into the app.
PS: to login in: the account number is "admin",the pass word is 123456
